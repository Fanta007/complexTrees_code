## On Statistical Analysis of Complex Tree-shaped 3D Objects
This is an example code for the paper "Learning Generative Models of the Geometry and Topology of Tree-like 3D Objects" by Guan Wang, Hamid Laga, and Anuj Srivastava.


### Usage

- compile DynamicProgrammingQ.c using mex function in matlab
- run eg1_geodesic_botanTrees.m to compute the geodesic between a pair of botancial trees
- run eg1_mean_botanTrees.m to compute the mean shape for a group of botancial trees
- run eg1_modesAndSamples_botanTrees.m to compute the principal variance mode and random samples for a group of botancial trees

The same operations are applied to neuron sturctures, named as eg2_xxxx.m

### Geodesic Computation

### Mean Computation

### Modes, Random Samples Compututation
